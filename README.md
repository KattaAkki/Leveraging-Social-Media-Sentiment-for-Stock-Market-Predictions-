Business Scenario: The problem addressed is the challenge of accurately predicting stock prices, a crucial task for investors in financial markets. Traditional methods often fail to capture the complex dynamics of market behavior, leading to suboptimal predictions. By leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly multimodal deep learning and sentiment analysis, we seek to improve the accuracy and reliability of stock price forecasts.

process: 
1. Data Collection : Stock price data is sourced from Yahoo Finance, while Twitter data related to specific stock tickers is obtained through web scraping.
2. Data Preprocessing: Involves cleaning, filtering, and organizing the data. This includes handling missing values and normalizing numerical features.
3. Sentiment Analysis: The Twitter text data is preprocessed and run through VADER model to determine sentiment (polarity) scores in text.
4. Feature Engineering: Technical indicators like moving averages and Bollinger Bands are computed from the stock price data. 
5. Normalization: Min-max scaling is applied to scale the data, which is essential for LSTM models.
6. Model Architecture: LSTM neural networks are constructed, incorporating convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, bidirectional LSTM layers, dropout layers, and dense layers.
7. Model Training: The models are trained on the training dataset using both stock price data alone and stock price data combined with Twitter sentiment analysis.
8. Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated on separate validation and testing datasets to assess their performance. Mean squared error (MSE) is calculated to quantify prediction accuracy.

9. Future Directions:
a) Model Optimization: Further optimization of model architecture by using more advance and sophisticated neural networks could potentially improve prediction accuracy.

b) Additional External Factors: Exploring additional external factors and Sources like APIs that provide latest market related news and connecting them to the model could enhance the models' predictive capabilities a lot.

c) Real-time Prediction: Implementing real-time prediction capabilities to adapt to changing market conditions and provide timely insights.
